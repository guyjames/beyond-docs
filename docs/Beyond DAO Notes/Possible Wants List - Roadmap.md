## Possible wants list/roadmap:
- Create a coherent self-governing community that people want to be part of
- Tokenize participation (in order to drive uptake, either with [[DAO]] tokens or [[NFT]]s)
- Reward creators for their work
- Pool funds and resources in order to take on artistic projects
- Maybe co-buy [[NFT]]s or do [[crypto investing]] together
- Help to change cultural narrative away from dystopic visions and towards solarpunk/regen ones
- Learning community
- Aesthetic: cartoons, memes (can later be NFTs)
- Magazine/newsletter using Ghost
- Sub-DAOs (regional? Look into Friends With Benefits [[DAO]])
- Steps to follow in creating a [[DAO]] from [this article](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-dao-of-daos)
- **1. Product-Market Fit**
> “At this stage, **there should be no pretense of decentralization** — a core team is driving all product decisions by necessity, in the interest of finding product/market fit.”
- **2. Community Participation**
> "...crypto companies can and should start thinking about how to use **fees** and **tokens** to incentivize ongoing contribution to supercharge community involvement and loyalty.""
> "On the **fee** side, there’s a trade-off between charging fees to users to give to contributors, or not charging fees until the platform has built up sufficient network effects.""
> "On the **token** side, teams can issue tokens to a small group of community members to experiment with governance dynamics.""
- **3. Sufficient Decentralization**
> "After a team has successfully completed the first two steps, they’re ready to distribute tokens to the broader community. This is an alternative to a traditional IPO, SPAC, or acquisition, called “==Exit to Community==,” and is the point at which a project or company becomes a [[DAO]]."
> "[[DAO]]s are all about maximizing **stakeholder value**. The users and contributors are also the investors and owners. While community ownership seems weird and novel and almost hippie, it’s actually a more natural model than a few outside investors and board members dumping a bunch of money into a company and deciding what it should do."
